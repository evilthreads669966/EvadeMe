# EvadeMe
### An Android library for heuristics evasion that prevents your code from being tested. 
## User Instructions
1. Add the maven repository to your project's build.gradle file
```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```
2. Add the dependency to your app's build.gradle file
```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.evilthreads669966:evademe:2.1'
}
```
3. Use the evade ktx function inside of any android context.
```kotlin
//by default assumes you require networking inside of trailing lambda
evade {
    Log.d("EVADE", "EVIL THREADS");
}.onEscape{
    Toast.makeText(this, "We evaded with networking", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show()
}.onSuccess {
    Toast.makeText(this, "We executed the payload with networking", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show()
}

//maby you don't require any networking for your payload inside of trailing lambda
evade(requiresNetworking = false) {
    Log.d("EVADE", "EVIL THREADS");
}
```
## Important To Know
- evade is a suspension function
- any code inside of the evade scoping function is safe from analysis.
- evade is a KTX function with a receiver of type context
- evade by default assumes that your are passing a function that uses internet
  - If you have a payload that does not require internet then you can pass false to requiresNetworking optional parameter
    - Passing in false to evade allows to skip evasion checks that are related to network analysis

### Code Conventions
None of these is essential for a pull request, but they will all help.  They can also be
added after the original pull request but before a merge.

- We use idiomatic kotlin conventions
- Add yourself as an `@author` to the `.kt` files that you modify or create.
- Add some comments
- A few unit tests would help a lot as well -- someone has to do it.
- If you are able to provide a unit test then do.
    - Because of the types of libraries I develop often times it is hard to test.


### Working with the code
If you don't have an IDE preference we would recommend that you use
[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/)
